# Titanic Dataset for Applying Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning to Predicting survival using classification problem

This repository contains the **Titanic dataset**, which is widely used for **data analysis and machine learning projects**, particularly for **predicting survival** of passengers aboard the Titanic. This dataset is excellent for practicing **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling**.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about Titanic passengers, including their demographics, ticket details, and survival outcome.

### Columns:

| Column Name    | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| PassengerId    | Unique identifier for each passenger |
| Survived       | Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes) |
| Pclass         | Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd) |
| Name           | Name of the passenger |
| Sex            | Gender of the passenger |
| Age            | Age in years |
| SibSp          | Number of siblings/spouses aboard |
| Parch          | Number of parents/children aboard |
| Ticket         | Ticket number |
| Fare           | Passenger fare |
| Cabin          | Cabin number |
| Embarked       | Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton) |
